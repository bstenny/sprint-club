        question: "Do I need to be fast already?",
        answer: "No. You need to be willing to work. Speed is a skill we develop—what matters is your effort and consistency. We program for all levels and progress intelligently.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is it really men-only?",
        answer: "Yes. Sprint Club is launching as a men-only training group. This may change in the future, but for now we're focused on building the strongest men's sprint community in Denver.",
    },
    {
        question: "What if I'm coming back from injury?",
        answer: "You're welcome. We program intelligently and can scale intensity. Just communicate with coaches so we can adjust your session appropriately. Speed development can actually be part of your return-to-play.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do you time reps?",
        answer: "Yes. Timing provides feedback, keeps you honest, and tracks progress. But we're not chasing times obsessively—we're building better sprinters.",
    },
    {
        question: "Where do you meet?",
        answer: "Denver-area tracks. Specific locations are announced to waitlist members before each session. We rotate between a few quality facilities.",
    },
    {
        question: "What should I bring?",
        answer: "Running shoes (spikes optional but welcome), water, and a willingness to work. We provide the structure, cues, and timing equipment.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is there a membership cost?",
        answer: "Pricing will be announced to waitlist members first. We're building something premium but accessible. Join the waitlist for early access to founding member rates.",
    },
